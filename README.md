## Lessions 1: Functions of skeletal system
Anthropology, stature, bone=dynamic, osteoporosis, dry bone=osseous tissue, Articular cartilage, dense connective tissue, 
dense irregular or dense regular connective tissue can be found in  periosteum=found outer protect bone except in Articular cartilage region, 
when we're talking about ligaments and tendons, those are going to be a type of density regular connective tissue.
Epithelial tissue=important in terms of paranasal sinuses. So if you think of my sinuses are acting up, it's typically an inflammation of this epithelial tissue.
adipose tissue and the neurovasculature=nerve, artery, and vein
nerves are important in terms of communicating with your central nervous system, so your brain and your spinal cord. Artery is what's bringing the supply to bones, so blood supply. And then veins are going to drain the blood, so returning to the heart.
marrow cavity or the medullary cavity, And within that, in a living individual, you can have that yellow fat marrow. That's very important in terms of energy storage called adipose tissue.
bone is dynamic structure, changes throughout life unlike dry bone

skeletal system=support system=allows for us to stay in bipedally and on two legs
in terms of as an attachment point=these ligaments and these tendons actually attaching to certain parts of the bone=muscle tendons particularly when you have these big bumps
protect certain other internal organs= skull, that calvaria or skullcap protecting the brain=rib cage or thorax protecting your lungs as well as your heart.
thyroid gland and your parathyroid glands, that will help keep certain amounts of calcium within the bone or release it if need be. Phosphorus is another mineral that's stored within the bone, not as quite as high amounts as calcium, but it will play a role in terms of mineral release and storage as well.

hemopoiesis=all types of blood cell production, red blood cells, white blood cells etc and that's going to be formed within red bone marrow. 
red bone marrow
Juvenile bones are going to have huge amounts of red bone marrow
adulthood, there's only going to be certain areas of bone that are actually going to form red blood cells.
epiphyses, these are going to be the ends of long bones and then in certain other bones such as your os coxa or hip bones, certain areas in terms of the ribs in adulthood will still form these red blood cells.
adulthood, a lot of that red bone marrow is differentiated into yellow bone marrow, yellow bone marrow is what we think about when we think about marrow. It's that fatty tissue that's actually within the hollow portions of the bone. . It's important in terms of triglyceride storage so that fatty storage as energy storage for these yellow bone marrow.


## Lessions 2: Osseous tissue and cells
how it get hard, focuse on extracellular matrix, histological slide of bone tissue,  about 15% of water, but what I want us to focus on really are these 30% of collagen fibers(organic material) and these 55% of crystallized mineral salts(inorganic material). Collagen fibers=organic material of the extracellular matrix and this is going to be secreted by certain cells referred to as osteoblasts. anytime you see this term blast, you know that something is being secreted. In this case, we're talking about the organic material and then, inorganic materials=55% of the extracellular matrix or those minerals. Specifically, hydroxyapatite=i misspell it all the time. So, this(inorganic materials, specially hydroxyapatite) is what's going to harden with the presence of these collagen fiber.  it's important to note, that you're not going to have the hardness of the bone without the presence of the organic material, so those secretions of the osteoblasts.  would you have collagen and why would you have this component that supposedly is going to make the bone softer? Because with that minerals, that's what's really making it structurally sound, collagen fibers=prevent against tensile pressures=not allowing the bone to shatter, flexibility in the bone in order to deal with the shocks, if you didn't have collagen fibers, you would have this really brittle bone, so equally fragile. So, you need both components to really get the structurally sound and capable of movement, a bone cyst or skeletal system that we have.

Cells in Osseous Tissue, four cells in the osseous tissue, first is Osteoprogenitor Cells (or Osteogenic Cells), and these are examples of stem cells that differentiate/develops into osteoblast cell, These are going to be found in higher densities associated with the outer surfaces of bone(periosteum), and within that medullary cavity as well(endosteum), and these are going to differentiate into osteoblasts. there's that term again, the blast. So we know, that this is going to be important in terms of that extracellular matrix. So, these(osteoblasts) are what are actually building the bone. So, building that extracellular matrix that will eventually ossify or calcify, and create the hard bone that we're familiar with. So, you're going to have these(osteoblasts) also in higher densities associated with that outer edge of the bone, as well as within that medullary cavity. Now, what happens with those osteoblasts, they're going to secrete the extracellular matrix, they are going to keep surrounding itself with extracellular matrix or secretion, and eventually, it will lock itself in, and then you're going to have what the creation of what's referred to as an osteocyte, and these are the main cells or the mature bone cells. So, once there's no more secretion of extracellular matrix, that's when you're going to have the development of these osteocytes.  Now, it's important to note that these cells are not dead. So, not what we had in terms of the epidermis with those corneocytes, these cells are still doing something. They're still communicating with other osteocytes in order to upkeep the daily metabolism of the bone tissue. One thing I want you to know with this really nice illustration are all these processes of the osteocytes. What's going to happen is that these processes are going to communicate with processes of another osteocyte, so being able to actually communicate between cells. Lastly, the fourth cell I want you to know are the osteoclast. Anytime you have this suffix of clast, that's going to mean resorption, or bone, or some type of breakdown. In this case, it's going to be the breakdown of bone tissue. Now, this seems like a bad thing, but it's actually part of very normal processes. In order to keep the bone tissue strong and healthy, you're going to have to break down some of the older tissue. It also can have implications if osteoclastic activity is bumped up. So, that's the case of what's happening in terms of osteoporosis, where it going to break down bone without having new bone formed by the osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are huge cells. So, huge in comparison to the other cells that we just discussed. Also, right in this region right here, you have what's referred to as a ruffled border. So this is a very extremely infolded type of plasma membrane, and from here, you're going to have secretions of a lysosomal or enzymes, so very high in terms of its acid content in order to actually break down the bone. Now, one thing I want to note, is that the first three cells that we discuss, the osteogenic cells, the osteoblasts, and osteocytes are part of the lifecycle of one type of cell. So, an osteogenic cell will turn into(differentiate into) an osteoblast, that osteoblast(forms bone matrix) will secrete that extracellular matrix and keep surrounding itself until it doesn't secrete anymore, and once that occurs, then that's referred to as osteocytes(maintains bone tissues). So, the end of the life cycle in terms of this, is the osteocyte important in terms of that daily metabolism. Now, this osteoclast is its own thing. It's not part of this lifecycle, it's actually going to form by the creation or the coagulation of 50 monocytes, or up to 50 monocytes. So, it's a completely different lifecycle, but also just as important in terms of actually breaking down the bone and allowing for healthy bone to stay.

Compact v. Spongy Bone,  different names for the same thing(terminology), when we're talking about compact bone sometimes you can hear compact bone referred to as cortical or dense bone, and then in terms of spongy bone, you may hear the terms trabecular or cancellous. Now, a lot of times I will use the term trabecular because really this type of bone is composed of trabeculae or these tiny spines/spicules of bone. So, this is a femur that has been sectioned, sagittally sectioned, and it's really nice in terms of showing you the two different types of bone. I'm talking about these trabeculae these little spines of bone right here, and this is going to be that trabecular or spongy bone. Whereas you can see this much denser compact bone there's a really making up that strong portion of the diaphysis or the shaft of the bone. 
compact bone, it's a bit more solid so it's going be really important in terms of resisting bending, and this is going to form the external layers of all bones. So, even bones that are made up of almost exclusively spongy bone are going to have a layer of compact bone. So, every single bone is going to have a layer of compact bone. Also important in terms of the bulk of the shafts or the diaphysis of all long bones. So, you can see right here, this is compact bone and you'll have it in the majority of the long portion of long bones.

Whereas spongy bone, is going to be important in terms of strength in terms of compression. So, you'll have these in areas where you have joints. So, on the ends of bones are these epiphyses, these are going to be made up of almost exclusively spongy bone except for a small layer like I was saying of that compact bone. So, right around here even though the majority of this is made up of spongy bone, you're going to have compact bone on the edges. Now, these are going to contain larger spaces, and this is important for two main reasons. First, this really reduces the weight of the bone. If you think about it if all bound was made up of compact bone or that heavier bone, we wouldn't be able to move as freely as we do. So, it really reduces the weight it also serves as protection of that red bone marrow or of yellow bone marrow. So, remember in our previous presentation red bone marrow is important in terms of blood cell formation. So, really important in terms of protection of that. Now, where are you going to find spongy bone? The majority of your short bones. So, your carpal bones are examples of short bones. Flat bones, so the majority of your skullcap or calvaria area are composed of flat bones and irregular bones, and the best example of irregular bones are your vertebrae, or the bones that make up your spinal column. Last but not least these epiphyses or these ends of long bones, are going to be made up of spongy bone as well.

Components of Compact Bone, what is giving the compact bone that tree ring-like appearance? It's these neighboring osteons, or these structural units. Sometimes you'll hear osteons referred to as Haversian systems, or the eponym in terms of osteons. That's what is giving this very distinct tree ring-like appearance that you have. Now, these osteons or these structural units are very well-organized. They're going to be organized along lines of stress. So, if a certain type of stress is always occurring on a bone, these osteons are going to form in such a way, in order to protect or to keep the bones structurally sound. These osteons change throughout life. You'll have the formation of new osteons, and you'll have osteons break down. So, they're constantly changing as part of this dynamic skeletal system. Now, if you look at a single osteon, let's talk about the components within that structural unit. You're going to have concentric lamellae, and that is the actual ring portions of the osteon, and these are just that mineralized or that hardened extracellular matrix. Dotted within that concentric lamellae, you're going to have the mature bone cells, or the osteocytes. Now, in the middle of the osteons, so if you look at a histological slide, you'll have that dark portion. That's the central canal(passageway for neurovasculature and lymphatics). So, you can see it right here, with the red and the blue, and anytime you see red and blue, when you're looking at an anatomical illustration, you know red means artery, blue means vein, and then yellow is typically going to be the nerve. So, you'll have not only the nerve, artery, and vein, you'll also have lymphatics that are going to drain areas in terms of the bone, drain length from the bone. Now, within that extracellular matrix, or within the concentric lamellae, you'll have these little holes, or lacunae. Lacunae actually means, "a lake" In Latin. So, you could think of these little lakes within the concentric lamellae, that are going to have osteocytes, or those mature cells sitting within. So they're going to have these multiple ones associated with each osteon. So you can see here's a close up of that. You'll have the osteocytes sitting in this lacunae, or this kind of pit-like region. Now, kind of extensions of these lacunae are one of the coolest words in anatomy, canaliculi, and that's these extensions of the lacunae that are allowing for these processes to sit in there. Remember I said the osteocytes they're still alive. They're not secreting extracellular matrix anymore. They're important in terms of communication between different osteocytes, also allowing for exchange of nutrients, the removal of waste associated with the osteons structural unit. Now, like I said, osteons are going to be dynamic. They're going to change throughout life. You'll have the formation of new osteons. You'll also have the breakdown of old osteons. That's what this interstitial lamellae are. So, you'll have these nice structurally sound osteons, and then you're going to have fragments of older osteons, which will eventually break down completely, and all that waste will be removed from the bone. But you can still see these fragments of older osteons that could still have osteocytes within, you could still have those canaliculi in there as well. Now, in order for neurovasculature to get into the bone, you're going to have these perforating or Volkmann's canals, and I really like this illustration here. You can see, obviously, that blood supply has to move into the bone. So, you'll have these transverse canals that will lead into the central canal. So, penetrating not only the periosteum, but also that compact bone, to allow for the neurovasculature to get into the bone. That's a really important thing I want to note here. I want to stop here. Neurovasculature is very important in terms of allowing bone to be dynamic. If you didn't have the arterial supply that's going to supply oxygen and different nutrients to the bone, you wouldn't be able to change. So, there's going to be these perforating canals throughout the entirety of the bone. Then lastly, the last part I want to discuss is the circumferential lamellae, and importantly, you'll have this along the outer edges of the bone, and these are almost like super wide concentric lamellae, but in terms of the entirety of the bone. One other thing I want to note here is that the periosteum, that outer connective tissue layer, is going to be closely adhered to the circumferential lamellae. So, in fact, you're going to have components of that connective tissue actually moving into the bony matrix at this concentric lamellae. Now, circumferential lamellae is important in terms of appositional growth, and we'll talk about this in a lot more detail. But appositional growth means growth in terms of bone width, not length, but width. So, you're going to have a lot of those osteogenesis cells and osteoblasts in this area for the formation of new osteons when you're having growth in terms of width.
