# Musculoskeletal-and-Integumentary-Systems
Anthropology, stature, bone=dynamic, osteoporosis, dry bone=osseous tissue, Articular cartilage, dense connective tissue, 
dense irregular or dense regular connective tissue can be found in  periosteum=found outer protect bone except in Articular cartilage region, 
when we're talking about ligaments and tendons, those are going to be a type of density regular connective tissue.
Epithelial tissue=important in terms of paranasal sinuses. So if you think of my sinuses are acting up, it's typically an inflammation of this epithelial tissue.
adipose tissue and the neurovasculature=nerve, artery, and vein
nerves are important in terms of communicating with your central nervous system, so your brain and your spinal cord. Artery is what's bringing the supply to bones, so blood supply. And then veins are going to drain the blood, so returning to the heart.
marrow cavity or the medullary cavity, And within that, in a living individual, you can have that yellow fat marrow. That's very important in terms of energy storage called adipose tissue.
bone is dynamic structure, changes throughout life unlike dry bone

skeletal system=support system=allows for us to stay in bipedally and on two legs
in terms of as an attachment point=these ligaments and these tendons actually attaching to certain parts of the bone=muscle tendons particularly when you have these big bumps
protect certain other internal organs= skull, that calvaria or skullcap protecting the brain=rib cage or thorax protecting your lungs as well as your heart.
thyroid gland and your parathyroid glands, that will help keep certain amounts of calcium within the bone or release it if need be. Phosphorus is another mineral that's stored within the bone, not as quite as high amounts as calcium, but it will play a role in terms of mineral release and storage as well.

hemopoiesis=all types of blood cell production, red blood cells, white blood cells etc and that's going to be formed within red bone marrow. 
red bone marrow
Juvenile bones are going to have huge amounts of red bone marrow
adulthood, there's only going to be certain areas of bone that are actually going to form red blood cells.
epiphyses, these are going to be the ends of long bones and then in certain other bones such as your os coxa or hip bones, certain areas in terms of the ribs in adulthood will still form these red blood cells.
adulthood, a lot of that red bone marrow is differentiated into yellow bone marrow, yellow bone marrow is what we think about when we think about marrow. It's that fatty tissue that's actually within the hollow portions of the bone. . It's important in terms of triglyceride storage so that fatty storage as energy storage for these yellow bone marrow.
